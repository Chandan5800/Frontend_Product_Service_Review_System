                <p>A product and service review system is a platform or mechanism that allows users to share their opinions and feedback on products and services they have used. These reviews help other potential customers make informed decisions when considering a purchase or using a service. Such systems are commonly found on e-commerce websites, social media platforms, and dedicated review websites. Here's a brief overview of how a product and service review system works:</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <b>Publication: </b>Once a review is approved, it is published on the platform for other users to see. Reviews are often organized by product or service, making it easy for potential customers to find the information they need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Rating Aggregation: </b>The review system often calculates an aggregate rating based on the individual ratings provided by users. This aggregated rating is usually displayed prominently and provides a quick summary of the product or service's quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Response from Businesses: </b>Businesses may have the option to respond to reviews, addressing concerns or thanking customers for positive feedback. This interaction can enhance the customer-business relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Continuous Feedback: </b>The review system continues to collect feedback over time, allowing users to see how products or services evolve and improve.
                </p>
                <p><b>Impact on Purchasing Decisions: </b>Potential customers use the information gathered from reviews to make purchasing decisions. Positive reviews can boost sales, while negative reviews can lead to improvements or inform potential customers about drawbacks.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Trust and Credibility: </b>Users often rely on product and service reviews to make informed decisions. They consider the credibility of the reviewer, the number of reviews, and the overall sentiment expressed in the reviews.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Incentives: </b>Some review systems offer incentives for users to leave reviews, such as discounts or rewards, which can help encourage more participation.
